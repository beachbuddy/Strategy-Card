# Strategy-Card

Time for some fun.  You are trying to solve a problem in which there are multiple strategies. Perhaps you have gamed the strategies
and tracked the success of each strategy.  Alternatively, you have executed each strategy any number of times and tracked the
success rate of each strategy.  The program will import a descriptive string of each strategy and the win rate of each strategy
from an Excel file.  The output will be a strategy card, a scatter plot with each strategy as a marker and the size of the marker
is commensurate with the win rate.  The location and color of each marker is random on the card.
